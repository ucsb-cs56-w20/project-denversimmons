# Configuration for OAuth

# Running on Localhost.

1.  You _must first_ configure a Google OAuth app for http://localhost:8080 and obtain the client-id and client-secret.

    Follow the instructions here: <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/topics/oauth_google_setup>.

    - For the application url, use <http://localhost:8080>
    - For the callback url, also use <http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/google>
    - Note that on localhost, you typically need use `http` not `https`

2.  You must then copy the file `localhost.json.SAMPLE` to the file `localhost.json`.

    - Note that you SHOULD NOT edit `localhost.json.SAMPLE` directly.
    - The copied file `localhost.json` will NOT be commited to GitHub; it's in the `.gitignore`

3.  Then, edit the `localhost.json` file and put in your client id and client secret in the places indicated.

4.  Finally, IN EACH terminal session where you are going to run `mvn spring-boot:run`, and EACH TIME after you
    change the values in `localhost.json`, execute this command to load those values into the Unix environment:

    ```
    source env.sh
    ```

    That means to source the contents of `env.sh` into the
    current shell. That loads the contents of `localhost.json` into the environment variable `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON`, which
    causes those values to override those in the `application.properties` file.

    On `bash`, you can also use `. env.sh` (a dot followed by a space followed by `env.sh`)

5.  Now you are ready to do `mvn spring-boot:run` as usual, and see the application on <http://localhost:8080>.

    Try logging in with your GitHub account.

# Running on Heroku.

To run on Heroku, you must go BACK to GitHub and set up a DIFFERENT client id and client secret than the one you used for
localhost.

1.  Go to the heroku.com dashboard and create a new Heroku app with the name `cs56-f19-lab06-githubid`, replacing `github` with your
    github id.

1.  Now you must configure a Google OAuth app for `https://cs56-w20-lab07-githubid.herokuapp.com` and obtain the client-id and client-secret.

    Follow the instructions here: <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/topics/oauth_google_setup>.
    
    - For the callback url, use <https://cs56-w20-lab07-githubid.herokuapp.com/login/oauth2/code/google>  
    - Note that on Heroku, you typically need use `https` not `http`, and be sure to substitute YOUR githubid in place of githubid; also if you abbreviated your Heroku application name, use that in the callback url.

2.  You must then copy the file `heroku.json.SAMPLE` to the file `heroku.json`.

    - Note that you SHOULD NOT edit `heroku.json.SAMPLE` directly.
    - The copied file `localhost.json` will NOT be commited to GitHub; it's in the `.gitignore`

3.  Then, edit the `heroku.json` file and put in your client id and client secret in the places indicated.

4.  Now, you need either to be logged into CSIL where you can run the heroku command line tool, or you need the heroku
    command line (CLI) installed on your local system.

    Use `heroku login` to login to the command line tool.

    The run the following script from the repo. You need to do this in the same directory where you entered
    the client id and client secret values into the `heroku.json` file.

    The name of the Heroku app should match yours (e.g. change `githubid` to your githubid)

    ```
    ./setHerokuEnv.py --app cs56-w20-lab07-githubid
    ```

    You should now be able to go to the Heroku Dashboard for your app online, e.g. this link (replacing `githubid` with yours)

    - <https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/cs56-w20-lab07-githubid/settings>

    Click "Reveal Config Vars". You should see a configuration variable called `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` that contains
    the values that you entered for client id and client secret (i.e the contents of `heroku.json`).

5.  Now you are ready to do the steps you did in lab02 to connect your Heroku App to your Github repo, and deploy your app to Heroku and see it running.
